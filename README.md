# Blackjack

## About

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a card game where players try to get as close to 21 points as 
possible without going over. This program uses images drawn with text characters, called ASCII art. 
American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a mapping of text characters to 
numeric codes that computers used before Unicode replaced it. The playing cards in this program 
are an example of ASCII art:
